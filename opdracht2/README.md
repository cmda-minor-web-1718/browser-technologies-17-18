>Feature detection involves working out whether a browser supports a certain block of code, and running different code dependent on whether it does (or doesn't), so that the browser can always provide a working experience rather crashing/erroring in some browsers. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection)

## Hamburger menu
The hamburger is often used in a lot of modern site, but would happen if we have javascript disabled. Is the hamburger still functional? If not, how can we make the menu still functional for the people who doesn't have javacript enabled?
